# plant (prey v predator simulation via sfsim)
A C++ application using SFML for graphics and the sfsim simulation library for vector operations.

## Prerequisites

You'll need these tools installed on your system:

1. **Git** - To clone the repository
2. **CMake** (version 3.15 or higher) - Build system generator
3. **vcpkg** - C++ package manager for dependencies
4. **C++ Compiler** with C++17 support
5. **Development Environment** - Any IDE/editor that supports CMake

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samif0/plant.git
```

### Step 2: Install and Setup vcpkg

vcpkg manages our C++ dependencies (SFML). You'll need to install it globally:

1. **Clone vcpkg** to a permanent location on your system:
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git <path>
   cd <path>
   ```

2. **Bootstrap vcpkg**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   
   # macOS/Linux
   ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
   ```

3. **Set VCPKG_ROOT environment variable**:
   
   ```bash
   export VCPKG_ROOT=<path>
   ```
   
   **Critical**: Restart your terminal/IDE after setting this variable.

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   echo $VCPKG_ROOT    # Should show your vcpkg path
   $VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg version  # Should show vcpkg version info
   ```

### Step 3: Setup External Dependencies

The `external/` directory is gitignored, so you need to populate it manually:

```bash
# From the project root
mkdir external
cd external
git clone https://github.com/samif0/sfsim.git
cd ..
```

**Verify**: You should now have `external/sfsim/include/math/vector.hpp`

### Step 4: Build the Project

CMake will automatically install SFML and other dependencies through vcpkg during the configure step.

#### Using CMake Presets
```bash
# Build
cmake -B build -S .
cd build
make

# Run
./plant

```

## Project Structure

```
plant/
├── CMakeLists.txt          # Build configuration
├── CMakePresets.json       # Platform-specific presets
├── vcpkg.json             # Dependencies (SFML)
├── include/            
├── src/main.cpp           # Application entry point
├── external/              # External libs
│   └── sfsim/             # Simulation library (YOU MUST CLONE)
└── build/                 # Build output (generated)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "VCPKG_ROOT environment variable is not set"
- Set the environment variable: `export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg`
- **Restart your terminal completely**
- Verify: `echo $VCPKG_ROOT`

### "Could not find SFML"
- CMake should automatically install SFML through vcpkg
- If issues persist, verify vcpkg integration: `$VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg integrate install`

### "sfsim headers not found"
- Clone sfsim: `git clone https://github.com/samif0/sfsim.git external/sfsim`
- Verify file exists: `external/sfsim/include/math/vector.hpp`

### Platform Triplets
Use the correct vcpkg triplet for your system:
- Windows 64-bit: `x64-windows`
- macOS ARM (M1/M2): `arm64-osx`
- macOS Intel: `x64-osx`  
- Linux 64-bit: `x64-linux`

### Missing Files After Git Clone
These directories/files are gitignored and missing after clone:
- `build/` - Created during build
- `CMakeCache.txt` - Generated by CMake
